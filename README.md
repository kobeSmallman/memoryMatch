Mobile App Cit 2269

MemoryMatch

I tried to incorporate some new things I haven't done yet in this project AND i HAD A GOOD TIME!!! Making this app was fun!

New things I did that I haven't done before: Using the camera to take pictures, animation like flipping and sounds via the App.js when I am on certain pages it will play a default sound or a game mode sound. There is also sounds when you get a match or incorrect guess but I already did something a bit more similiar to that in the sound board project. 

Description: This project is designed to allow the user to sign with a name, if the name already exists you can be that person (I KNOW NO SECURITY) or you can type a new name and be a new user. You can take a picture and add it as a custom image for one of the cards. The more custom cards the more of the custom ones you will see. Defaults are there if you don't want to add anymore though. Once you have signed in you can see the leaderboards of all the users on that device who have played and their score, with difficulty level they got the respective score on. Don't know how to play? No problem there is a description/How to on the homepage. Once you decide you want to play continue to play, choose a difficulty level and play! You get a certain amount of lives, once you die/run out of all lives... That's it. Enjoy the game, I didn't end up allowing to add from files on phone because I did that last project with the soundboard and well, that was a pain. Not to say it wasn't fun, but I had other things to learn this time. 

:D
